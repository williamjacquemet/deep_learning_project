## *Perceptron Part*

`arraynumpy.py` is a python file that represent a perceptron that learns linear classification with 2 gaussians vectors.


## *Deep Neural Network Part*

`urbanNN.py` is a python file that load wav files and feed a Neural Network in order to predict them.

The wav files are from [analyticsvidhya](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-urban-sound-classification/)

`result.csv` is the result of the prediction of the NN
### *In order to make the `urbanNN.py` file works:*

- download the wav files from : [analytics google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0By0bAi7hOBAFUHVXd1JCN3MwTEU)
- the folder `Train`, `Test` and the excel files `train.csv` and `test.csv` must be in the **_same_** directory that the `urbanNN.py`
-
